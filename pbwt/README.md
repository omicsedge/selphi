This is a slimmed down version of Richard Durbin's <rd@sanger.ac.uk> pbwt repository.
We have limited the code to functions needed for Selphi, and added our own functions to
efficiently match target haplotypes to a reference panel and save the matches in
sparse matrix format.

For full documentation of the original code, please see [richarddurbin/pbwt](https://github.com/richarddurbin/pbwt).
